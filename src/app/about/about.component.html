                I am a student studying IT Web Programming at the NSCC Truro Campus. I suppose I first obtained my interest in tech from my father, who is a professional graphic and front-end designer. Computer classes were my favorite in high school. I later enrolled into college at the NSCC Truro Campus, originally intending to study game development. I made a wiser decision in changing to a more professional web development career. 
                <br><br>
                I was born in Ontario, moving to Nova Scotia when I was about 5 years old. I was born with hearing loss, wearing hearing aids and later on glasses, for my whole life. Instead of being hindered by this, I decided to adapt and overcome. I believe I can get through anything. I care about others, I feel for those who are helpless or in need. Iâ€™m interested in talking with anyone, disabled or able, tech-savvy or not. 
                Feel free to contact me.
